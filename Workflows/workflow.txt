🎉 10 Years at Inara Technologies 🎉 
A whole decade. What an incredible journey it's been.
Fresh out of university, a dear friend shared a remote opportunity that felt like the perfect fit—especially with a baby on the way and a planned break just a few months in. I never imagined that conversation would lead to 10 incredible years with the same company.
The unwavering support, the flexibility, and the trust Inara Technologies placed in me from day one made all the difference. It's not just a workplace—it's a place where people truly matter.
Here's to the memories, growth, and everything that’s yet to come. 🧡 🎉

Enhancing Cybersecurity with Standardized Controls
In today’s evolving threat landscape, organizations must align with industry standards to strengthen their security posture. I’ve compiled a document on Cybersecurity Standards and Associated Controls, providing a structured approach to managing security risks effectively.
This document outlines key cybersecurity frameworks, best practices, and associated controls to help organizations achieve compliance and improve their resilience against cyber threats.
Let’s work together to create a more secure digital environment!
